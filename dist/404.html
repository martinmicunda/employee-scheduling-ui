<!--
This 404 is only use for Github Pages when user refresh page as we are using Angular HTML5 mode
without real back end and HTML5 mode needs to rewrite URL server configuration
(http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16626326/can-one-host-an-angular-js-based-static-blog-on-github).

However GitHub, let us setup a custom 404 page. We setup a simple 404.html page in the root of our
GitHub pages site. This 404 page, inserts the hash AngularJS needs behind the scenes into the URL
and then calls a redirect to it. As we are using a window.location.replace, the 404.html page doesn't
show up in the browser history.
